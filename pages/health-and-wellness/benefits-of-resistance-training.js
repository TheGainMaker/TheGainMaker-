      <p className="mb-4">
        Resistance training is one of the most effective and efficient ways to improve health, build muscle, and enhance quality of life. Whether you're lifting dumbbells, using machines, performing bodyweight exercises, or training with bands, resistance training provides a wide range of benefits for people of all ages and fitness levels.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">What Is Resistance Training?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Resistance training (also known as strength training or weight training) is any exercise that causes your muscles to contract against an external resistance. This resistance can come from weights, bands, machines, or your own bodyweight. The goal is to improve muscular strength, endurance, size, and power.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Key Terms Explained</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Hypertrophy:</strong> The enlargement of muscle fibers resulting from resistance training. This leads to increased muscle size and definition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Strength Training:</strong> Focuses on increasing the maximum amount of force a muscle or group of muscles can produce.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Powerlifting:</strong> A sport and training style focused on maximal strength in three main lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. It emphasizes low reps with heavy weights.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Top Benefits of Resistance Training</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3">
        <li>
          <strong>Builds and Maintains Muscle Mass:</strong> Helps preserve muscle as you age, which naturally declines starting around age 30.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Increases Metabolism:</strong> Muscle burns more calories at rest than fat. The more muscle you have, the higher your resting metabolic rate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improves Strength and Functional Ability:</strong> Makes everyday tasks like carrying groceries, climbing stairs, or lifting objects easier and safer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protects Against Injury:</strong> Strengthens connective tissues and joints, reducing the risk of injury during daily movement or sport.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Boosts Bone Density:</strong> Resistance training stimulates bone growth and helps prevent osteoporosis and fractures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improves Insulin Sensitivity:</strong> Helps the body use insulin more effectively, reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enhances Mood and Mental Health:</strong> Promotes the release of endorphins and other feel-good chemicals that improve mood, reduce anxiety, and combat depression.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Supports Healthy Aging:</strong> Maintains strength, independence, and balance into older age, reducing fall risk and increasing mobility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improves Posture and Core Stability:</strong> Strengthens stabilizing muscles, improving alignment, balance, and back health.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Boosts Self-Esteem and Confidence:</strong> Seeing progress and feeling physically strong contributes to a better body image and self-belief.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Types of Resistance Training</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Bodyweight Training:</strong> Includes push-ups, squats, lunges, and planks using your own body for resistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Free Weights:</strong> Uses dumbbells, barbells, and kettlebells for versatile and scalable workouts.</li>
        <li><strong>Machines:</strong> Provide controlled resistance and are helpful for beginners or isolating specific muscles.</li>
        <li><strong>Resistance Bands:</strong> Portable, joint-friendly, and suitable for rehab or full-body training.</li>
        <li><strong>Powerlifting:</strong> Focused on maximal strength and includes heavy compound lifts with progressive overload.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">How Often Should You Do It?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For general health, aim for resistance training at least <strong>2–3 times per week</strong>, targeting all major muscle groups. For hypertrophy or strength goals, training each muscle group <strong>2 times per week</strong> with progressive overload is optimal.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Tips to Get Started</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>Start with bodyweight or light resistance to master proper form.</li>
        <li>Follow a structured plan to track sets, reps, and progress.</li>
        <li>Progress slowly—add weight, reps, or sets over time.</li>
        <li>Incorporate both compound (multi-joint) and isolation exercises.</li>
        <li>Rest at least 48 hours between training the same muscle group.</li>
        <li>Stay consistent: even 15–30 minutes can deliver results if done regularly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">Final Takeaway</h2>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Resistance training is one of the most powerful tools for building strength, protecting your long-term health, and improving both physical and mental performance. No matter your age or background, it's never too late to start lifting—and the benefits compound over time.
